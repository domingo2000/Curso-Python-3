    "# Python - The Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was originally developed by Guido van Rossum as a high level general purpose scripting language in the 1990s. It's strength has been in particular that it is easy to learn and that algorithms can be coded quickly (python has sometimes been described as executable pseudo-code). In recent years it has been increasingly used also for scientific computing and mathematics. Here one quickly reaches a point where the time spent waiting for a program to run becomes much longer than the time spent writing the code. Hence the need for speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial a number of ways of speeding python up will be explored. These will be tried in the context of a simple numerical algorithm. We will start with a simple but slow implementation and then look at what makes it slow and how to speed things up."

Below is the framework for a function to implement this method. Note the use of comments to describe the intent and usage of the function. Preconditions and post-conditions, in the form of assert statements, are used to help with debugging. Including such comments and conditions as a matter of course is a good practice, even for  code that you don't intend to maintain long term, as it can save you a lot of time hunting for bugs or when you invariably end up re-using code for other purposes than originally planned.\n",

However, once we have multiple threads in our program, or multiple other programs competing for a limited number of CPUs, the results could be quite different\n",

This provides vectors and matrices together with basic linear algebra routines implented largely in C++ and Fortran. These laregy mimick the type of basic functionality built into matlab. Many other python packages are built on top of this so that the numpy data types have become a defacto standard for any kind of scientific computing with python.  \n",

    "Basic usage for numpy: For convenience we `import numpy as np` (a fairly common practice in the python community)\n",
    "* Create matrices using something like `A = np.array( [ [1,2,3],[4,5,6] ] )` to create a 2 x 3 matrix. If all elements are integer this will be int64 type otherwise float64. You can query the dimensions with `A.shape`\n",
    "* Matrices can be indexed using `A[0,2] == 3` or using slices such as `A[0,1:3] == np.array([2,3.0])`\n",
    "* Arithmetic operations are overloaded to do mostly do what you would expect. The only significant exception is multiplication. When multiplying two arrays or matrices together we get the Schur product, that is the result has each of the corresponding elements from the input multiplied together (the operands must have the same dimensions). To get the normal inner product or matrix procut use `np.matmul`. E.g. np.matmul( np.array([[3,0],[0,2]]), A) or `A.dot(x)` to get an inner product that is effectively the same as matrix multiply if A is a matrix and x is a vector or matrix (but behaves slightly differently for other types of A & x).\n",
    "* Matrices can be built up using `np.hstack`, `np.vstack` (horizontal & vertical stacking)\n",
    "* To reshape a numpy array use `np.reshape`, this is particularly useful to turn 1 dimensional matrices into 2 dimensional matrices. `V = np.reshape(v,(len(v),1))` will turn an array v of length n into a n x 1 matrix V.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task for this method is to write a Gaussian elimination method using matrix multiplications. In a first year maths course you have probably seen that the elementary row operations of Gaussian elimination can be represented by pre-multiplying the matrix we are reducing with a suitable elementary matrix (an identity matrix with one off-diagonal element). So we can rewrite the algorithm to set up a suitable elementary matrix for each row reduction and pre-multiplying our matrix with this. For example for a 5 x 5 matrix $A$, to subtract 3 times the 2nd row from the fourth row we would pre-multiply $A$ by\n",

    "1. Collapsing all of the elementary matrices into a single square matrix that carries out all of the row reductions below the current element. For \"zeroing\" out the column below element $(i,i)$ this looks like an identity matrix with non-zero elements only below element $(i,i)$. This means we are only carrying out $O(n)$ matrix multiplications.\n",
    "2. Using sparse matrices. Since the matrices we are using are mostly zero, we only want to store, and more importantly multipy with, the non-zero entries of the matrix. This reduces the cost of matrix multiplications from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$, as the sparse matrix only has at most 2 non-zero entries per row.\n",

Here it makes sense to use the row based format (as when we are pre-multiplying with our special matrix, each entry in the answer is the inner product of a column of the right hand side with a row of our special matrix). For a compressed row sparse matrix the internal storage representation is:\n",

    "* `cdll.LoadLibrary(\"./gauss.so\")` allows you to load a library. There are some subtle differences between windows (loading a .dll library) and Linux (calling a .so library) but it should work on any system (also Macs). Note: a library can only be loaded once. A second call to LoadLibrary with the same filename will return a link to the same (previously loaded) library.  If you change the C++ source code an recompile you need to restart the kernel (or change the filename \n",
    "* Converting to the correct types: ctypes defines standard ctypes. Many things will convert automatically for example python `bytes` string to `const char *` \n",
    "* When working with C types explicitly you may need to convert. E.g. `i=cint(3)` and `i.value` (to go from python int to `cint` and back again)\n",
    "* Sometimes we need to specifically set things up correctly. We can use `ctypes.c_void_p` to get a generic pointer type (`void *`) or use `POINTER(c_int)` to create a pointer to an integer (in this case).\n",
    "* Arrays can be declared directly by multiplying a type by an integer size and using an initaliser list. For example  `c_int*3` is the same type as `int[3]` in C/C++. So `(c_int*3)()` constructs an unintialised array and `(c_int * 3)([0,1,2])` will create an initialised array. Just like in C, you can call a function expecting `POINTER(c_int)` with a an argument of type `c_int*3`, for example.\n",
    "* You may need to declare functions including their return type so that python needs how to call the function. For example if you had loaded a library `lib` containing a function called `func` then\n",
    "   * `lib.func.argtypes = [c_char_p, c_double]` says that `func(char *, double)` is the signature of the arguments\n",
    "   * `lib.func.restype = c_char` says func returns a `char` (rather than the default `int`)\n",
    "* Alternatively numpy provides a simple way to access the pointer to the underlying memory buffer. If `x` is a numpy array then `x.ctypes.data` contains the pointer. See [`numpy.ndarray.ctypes`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.ctypes.html) for more information\n",
    "* Yet another option is to modify the C code to have a set of simple helper functions for setting up the inputs and querying the outputs with all helper functions just receiving or returning basic values (int or double) that can be passed easily.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Have a go at calling the compiled library. To get started you might want to test that you can load and call simple functions. For example try calling the `hello(b\"world\")` function from the library or use the `check(A,i,j)` function to see if you can pass a matrix and return element `A[i][j]`."

    "## Method 4 - Using Numba\n",
    "What about compiling Python to give it the speed of C/C++/Fortran or at least something close to it?  There are a number of projects that are working towards this goal. Some examples of this include [PyPy](https://pypy.org/), [PyRex](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/) (no longer supported?) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/). Each of these make some attempt to compile python to native machine code. Note that there are also some other python implementation such as Jython and IronPython that target the Java Virtual Machine and .NET, but this is more about compatibility with a different software ecosystem than speed. Another issue that can cause confusion is that Python \"byte compiles\" modules - this is quite different to compiling to machine code with a language such as C or Fortran. It really just turns verbose ASCII source code to a much denser binary format that is still interpreted but much quicker for the interpreter to read (for example it doesn't contain any of the comments from the original source).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with trying to compile Python, rather than interpreting it, is that Python was _not_ designed for this. Hence most attempts at producing a fast, compiled version of Python tends to only be compatible with a subset of python. Here we will use the **Numba** package, because it is in very active development, can be mixed seamlessly with interpreted Python code, and particularly targets scientific computing applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does Numba work? It does a just-in-time (JIT) compilation of marked functions into machine code. That is we include a special library and \"tag\" functions to be compiled to machine code the first time that they are run. Such tagged functions can only use a subset of the python language (or else the numba package will fall back to running same code as the interpreter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic usage:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from numba import * #or just import jit, int32,float64\n",
    "\n",
    "@jit( float64(int32,float64[:,:]), nopython=True)\n",
    "def f(n,M):\n",
    "    return M[n,n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "What does all that mean?\n",
    "* `@jit` is a special decorator for the function that says this function should be just-in-time compiled by numba. In fact this is the only part that is really necessay, the rest of the lines in paranthesis could be left out. \n",
    "* The first optional argument to `@jit` provides a type specification for the function. In this case it says that the function returns a `float64` (64-bit floating point number or `double` in C). It takes two arguments the first of which is a 32-bit signed integer (as opposed to say a `uint8`), the second argument is a numpy matrix. If this is not specified, numba will \"guess\" the types based on the arguments to the function the first time it is called. \n",
    "* The same function may be compiled multiple times with different types (either by being called with different arguments or by specifying a list of type declarations). Note that the compile time makes the first time that the function is called relatively slow compared to subsequent calls\n",
    "* `nopython=True` tells the compiler that it should not accept any python code that it cannot compile (where it would need to fall back to the python interpreter). Without this @jit will always succeed in \"compiling\" the function but will potentially produce a function that is no faster than the standard interpreted python code. With the flag set, the compiler will raise an error if the function includes elements of python that it can't handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That should be enough to get you started. See the [Numba manual](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/index.html) for more information. Go ahead and write a version of the Gaussian elimination solver using Numba - not that you will need a wrapper function to translate the dictionary into numpy arrays first."

    "The strategy employed by Numba is virtually identical to that used in [Julia](http://julialang.org) to produce fast code. If you have a project that is entirely focussed on heavy-duty computational work, you may want to give this ago. For small amounts of numerical computation in a larger python project, Numba is entirely adequate though (and still improving rapidly due to ongoing development). For algorithms that are based less on numerical computations with vectors and matrices, you may also run into the limits of what Numba can't compile - this may require rewriting an algorithm in a slightly less natural (more fortran-ish) way. \n",
    "\n",
