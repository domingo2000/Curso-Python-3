Regular expressions are not unique to python, with relatively similar syntax used in a variety of tools (particularly in linux/unix). The [regular expression documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) gives all the details, but to get you started the string `r\"^[abc]\\d*\"` would match any line that \n",

    "   * has one of the characters in the set {'a','b','c'} (written as \"[abc]\") first\n",
    "   * is followed by zero or more digits \"\\d\" = digit, * means \"zero or more\", you could use \"+\" for \"one or more\"\n",
    "   * the string is written as a raw string (`r\"\"`) to make sure that \"\\\" is not interpreted as an escape character - since regular expressions make frequent use of the backslash\n",
    "   * it is also particularly useful and easy to mark a substring as a _group_. For example `r\"([xyz]+)\\1\"` means that we have a group consisting of one or more characters in {x,y,z} followed by the same group (group 1) repeating a second time. \n",
    "   * `import re` to get the library, then use `re.search(pattern,string)` to find a pattern in the given string, `re.search(pattern,string).group(1)` would give the substring of the first group in the time the pattern was matched (if the pattern was found at all).\n",

    "* For large strings we might want to identify the fields by name rather than having to remember the exact order in which they appear. The `.format` method on strings allows you to specify values either by position in the argument list (e.g. `{2}` would be the third argument) or by name (e.g. `{val}` would substitute 3.5 in `.format(val=3.5)`). In addition can specify a range of formatting options by following the name or number with `:` and a format (eg `:5.3f`). The formatting for fields is more flexible than with `%`, see the [format specification mini language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html?highlight=string#format-specification-mini-language) for details. You need to use `{{ }}` to insert `{ }` given the special meaning of the braces. \n",

    "\\authors{{ {Auth:^30} }}\"\"\".format(title,Auth=r\" \\& \".join(author), Rev=ver) )\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The template mechanism looks more like shell script string replacements using a `$` followed by a name to identify values to be replaced. The name may optionally be enclosed in braces. You need to first define a `Template(\"templatestring\")` and then use `.substitute()` to substitute for each of the `$` values. This function takes keyword arguments (like `.format()`) or a dictionary to obtain the values. This is pretty easy to use, particulary with `locals()` to create a dictionary of local variables. However, it has far fewer formatting options that the other methods\n",
